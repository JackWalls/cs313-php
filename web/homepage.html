			<p>Welcome to my site, as the title suggests my name is Jose Paredes. This site will
			primarily be used as a hub for my assignments for CS313 class that I am currently taking.
			</p>
			<p>Beyond that I guess an interest that I have that I can share is in hiking.
			I do it every saturday or so. I mainly go to a nearby regional park on the weekdays 
			and head up to a mountain trail on saturdays whenever I can. For the most part I go alone but 
			sometimes I have friends with me. I mostly enjoy it since it gives me an opportunity to zone 
			out everything else and life and reflect on how I'm doing so far.
